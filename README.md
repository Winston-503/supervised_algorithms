# Supervised Learning algorithms cheat sheet

![supervised_preview.jpg](../img/supervised_preview.jpg)

This repository provides cheat sheets for different supervised learning machine learning concepts and algorithms.
This is not a complete tutorial, but it can help you better understand the structure of machine learning or to refresh your memory.

To know more about a particular algorithm, just Google it or check for it in [sklearn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

The content is presented in two formats:
